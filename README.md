# Deep Learning

Deep learning is subset of a machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with feature-based learning. Artificial neural networks (ANN) or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.

## The Repository
The repository for Python is like a folder or storage space that contains all the files such as code, documentation, images, and more related to my experiments with Deep Learning. It also tracks every change that I or my team makes to each file.
